# ALIP Sandbox MVP

ALIP (Autonomous Learning Interface Protocol) is a Web3 educational sandbox designed to simulate real blockchain interactions in a risk-free environment.

This MVP represents the first functional prototype of the ALIP training layer.

## 🚀 Vision

Web3 adoption is slowed by fear.

One wrong transaction.
One malicious approval.
One misunderstood gas fee.

ALIP exists to remove that fear by allowing users to practice real blockchain interaction flows — without risking real funds.

Our long-term vision is to become the global standard training layer before real on-chain participation.

## 🧠 What This MVP Demonstrates

This Sandbox MVP simulates:

- Wallet interaction flows
- Transaction confirmation processes
- Smart contract approval scenarios
- Basic dApp user experience patterns
- Guided learning through interactive lessons

The goal is not to connect to a live blockchain.
The goal is behavioral learning through safe repetition.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project is structured into:

- `client/` – Frontend interface (Vite + TypeScript)
- `server/` – Backend simulation logic
- `shared/` – Shared utilities and types
- `script/` – Supporting scripts

The frontend provides an immersive sandbox UI.
The backend simulates transaction states and learning checkpoints.

## 🧭 Founder Note

ALIP is being built from the ground up with limited resources but high conviction.

The belief is simple:
Before mass Web3 adoption can happen, safe practice must exist.

This sandbox is the first step.
